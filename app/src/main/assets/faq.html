                <h3>Why does it take a long time to sync and scan my library?</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    If you have a large number of songs in your library, it may take a while to index them all so that we can send the song information to our servers and get mood tags. We have limited a single scan to 3,000 songs for better performance. If your library is larger, you can continue scanning it later until all your songs have been processed.

				<h3>So what is music eScape all about? </h3>
				<p class="desc">To look at the effects of music on changing your moods along a specific path.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>What's the difference between playlist and a mood journey?</h3>
				<p class="desc">A mood journey is a path that you create between moods on the draw screen. It contains a set of songs that are representative of the mood or series of moods you have drawn. A playlist always contains the same set of songs. If you like a particular playlist it’s a good idea to save it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>How do my songs get tagged with moods?</h3>
				<p class="desc">Music eScape analyses your music’s energy and valence using The Echo Nest’s audio analysis data technology. It compares your songs to a large database and then assigns a mood tag to the song. If you disagree with the assigned tag from The Echo Nest then you can retag it to the mood you believe it should be. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>On the draw screen why are some dots bigger than others?</h3>
				<p class="desc">The size of the dots is relative to the intensity of the mood tag, the bigger the dot the more intense the mood.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Why are there sometimes gaps in my playlists?</h3>
				<p class="desc">If there are no songs that are assigned to the specific area where you drew your journey then eScape bypasses that point.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Why can't I shuffle? </h3>
				<p class="desc">Because you are creating a journey that has a distinct beginning middle and end according to the moods you choose. The good thing is you can take as many journeys as you like.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How do I go back to my mood journey/now playing screen?</h3>
                <p class="desc">Press and hold down the player on the bottom of the screen.</p>
            </li>
